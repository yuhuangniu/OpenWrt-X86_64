Automatic compile OpenWrt X86-64 firmware using GitHub Actions.

The latest version of this project is supposed to be released on weekly basis. This firmware is mainly functioning for the purpose of proxying your network traffic transparently and seamlessly via [Shadowsocks R Plus](https://github.com/fw876/helloworld) and [OpenClash](https://github.com/vernesong/OpenClash/tree/master) while keeping minimum size in general. So any other common used plug-ins in OpenWrt may not be included. Please be aware of that.

[Lean's source code](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) is employed here. Thanks his great pioneering work.

If there are any issues to make OpenClash work properly, please go with this [configuration file](https://github.com/yuhuangniu/OpenWrt-x86_64/blob/master/config.yaml).

Hope you enjoy freedom in this brand-new cyber world!
